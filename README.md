# tower_of_hanoi
_Description_: Tower of Hanoi game written  in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

_Game Objective_: Move all of the discs from the left post to the right post.  You cannot put a larger disc on top of a small disc.

_Technologies Used_: The initial placement of the posts and discs were setup using HTML and CSS.  All of the game logic and movement of the discs was done in Javascript.  The game is deployed directly into the browser.

_Unresolved Issues_: The game logic is working and it updates the DOM elements but I still need to add
a win condition, a way to reset the game without refreshing the page, and a move tracker.

_Hosted Project URL_: (https://taylorjaredd.github.io/tower_of_hanoi/)

_Ongoing Plans_:  I plan on working on the unresolved issues and having an option to select the number
of discs to start with.
